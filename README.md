The idea of this repo is to simplify how talks submissions are managed for ZgPHP meetups.

## Submit a Talk
Having an idea is great, but we need one little step more from you - submit the idea and help us to organize next meetup! 

The process is extremely simple:

1. Create a .md file from the template and describe your topic (please follow the structure in the template)
2. Submit a pull request
3. Watch for comments on your PR (if any).

Once your PR is merged, your talk is scheduled for one of next meetups!

### Talk submission steps

Copy the [talk-description-template.md](https://github.com/zgphp/zgphp-meetup-talks/blob/master/talk-description-template.md) file from the root of this project and name it in the following format `your-name--talk-title-goes-here` (e.g. `zoran-antolovic--the-perfect-cheesecake`).

Within the file you'll find placeholders for:
- speaker full name
  - speaker contact info - we need a way of contacting you on time if something changes on our end or if we need some additional info
- talk title
- duration
- talk description
- speaker short bio
- requirements

Edit the file content and save it in a directory within the `meetup` directory that represents the meetup (i.e. the month) you're interested in talking at. For example, If you want to give a talk on ZgPHP Meetup in July, 2020., place your submission file in `meetups/2020/07` directory.

And that's it! You're now ready to make a new __pull request__ and complete your talk submission.
We'll take care of the rest or discuss the details with you in PR comments.

## Talks Wishlist

We'll use GitHub issue tracker on this project to establish a wishlist.  

If there is a topic you're interested in hearing more about, you're welcome to create a new issue and describe the topic.

⚠️ __Important__: Please, go through the issue list and see if there is an issue with the same (or very similar) topic. If there is something really similar to what you'd want to hear more about, add a thumb up 👍🏻 instead of creating a new issue.


## Disclaimer

We're experimenting with the process, feel free to suggest changes in the way we're handling talks submissions and wishlist.
