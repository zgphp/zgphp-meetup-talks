# Transpiling PHP

- __Speaker__: Miro Svrtan
- __Duration__: 45 min

## Description

PHP as a language can't rapidly follow the needs of the developers: we should look at other languages that decided to build custom DSLs over existing platforms/languages like TypeScript or Elixir. Both languages were born for different reasons, solving different problems and having unique takeaways on developer communities at large.

After a rather short introduction to them, I will cover benefits and pitfalls of these concepts with some examples from our community on how and what would be solved easily with preprocessing to PHP like generics, immutable structures and so on.

There are already some initiatives building upon this idea but they are not being widely recognized and I would love to introduce you to them and some of my work as well (which I have done as proof of concepts). 


## Speaker short bio

Building stuff is a passion of mine: it's not always about code, I try helping businesses build great products and teams. While I'm most often hired as senior developer, I also work as a trainer, helping other developers be better by teaching them new methodologies and sharing my experiences.
