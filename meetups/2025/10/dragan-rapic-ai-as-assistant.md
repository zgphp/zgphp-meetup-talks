# AI as an Assistant in Development – Opportunity or Threat

- __Speaker__: Dragan Rapić
- __Contact__: dragan.rapic@asee.io
- __Duration__: 25 min

## Description

The future is already here — AI is developing AI. But what does that mean for us as developers today?
In this session, I’ll share my experience using AI tools in everyday development work — what worked well, what didn’t, and where I think AI really shines (or fails). We’ll look at some practical examples, discuss real challenges, and talk about how we can use AI responsibly and effectively in our daily projects.

Dragan is a father, husband, problem solver, and engineer — in that order. Over his career, he’s mainly worked with web technologies and currently leads a software team at ASEE.
