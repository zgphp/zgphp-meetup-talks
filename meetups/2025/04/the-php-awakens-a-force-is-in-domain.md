## Description
In this session, I will show some real-life examples of using DDD in projects built with PHP. I will emphasize the good and some not-so-good things about using DDD. I will show that implementing DDD is not the problem and it's not something that will make your project so complicated that you'll spend twice more time to deliver it. In the end, I will also show that the DDD approach of building the software is also easy by using language such as PHP.

Through a set of examples, we'll dig into the practical implementation of DDD, looking into benefits and potential challenges. Throughout the session, I'll highlight both the strengths and limitations of using DDD in development. Contrary to common misconceptions, I'll demonstrate that integrating DDD principles doesn't necessarily complicate project delivery. Instead, it encourages developers to create robust, maintainable, and readable software.
